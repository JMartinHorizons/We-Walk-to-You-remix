# A Simple Digital Poem

A simple digital poem that builds each line from three lists created as an example for the Horizons Digital Writing lab.

I changed the background, the font, and some of the objects used. I also messed around with the line generation, namely adding an indented, reversed line every six lines.

My remixed version of [We Walk to You](https://marvelous-amused-marsupial.glitch.me/)
